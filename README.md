## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I understand and have a vision on how the app is going to look. I have the lessons of Unit-2 to review and use as references.

### Weaknesses:

Pretty much I need to be more comfortable with javascript fundamentals. 

### Opportunities:

This project will help me to dig more into React and how to use CRUD and components.

### Threats:

I get very frustraded really quick and it takes me a good amount of time to get out of my funck.
