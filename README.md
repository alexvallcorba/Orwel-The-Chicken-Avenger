## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

<!-- I have a good understanding of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. As such, I can better plan for what needs to be done and how long it will take. I also know which labs and excercise I can reference if I get lost along the way. -->

### Weaknesses:

<!-- I am still not terribly clear on CRUD and how to make sure I can carry each aspect out for this project. Additionally, I prefer to stick to functional components but given the parameters of the project, I'll need to use class components, as well. I will likely use most of my research time/manager help on these matters. -->

### Opportunities:

<!-- This project is the culmination of the last 2 weeks and will give me an opportunity to solidify my understanding of react. I also happen to be interested in the function of my app given my interests, so I am motivated to make it look usable and attractive. -->

### Threats:

<!-- Whenever I get stuck with an error or an issue, I tend to go down a rabbit hole of online searches and debugging. Often times, I don't timebox these episodes and lose a lot of time. While this is typically a favorable characteristic in a developer, I'll need to make sure I know when to ask for help. -->
